Help me create a Flutter application (woxxy) that performs the following tasks:

Woxxy is a local LAN filesharing application
The protocol is not secure, but ultra fast
It is created to quickly share large files over the LAN between coworkers
Security IS NOT an issue
The app should:

At start, broadcast the LAN to meet the other Woxxy running
Allow user to select another user in the LAN and then drag & drop FILES or Directories to the user.
Show progress status
